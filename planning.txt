Tabs (Excel) / Schmas (JSON) from USDM that we should generate to "automate edc build"
    
    mainTimeline (required)

    studyDesignEncounters - each visit (required)

    studyDesignActivities - each activity (required) - map to the eCRFs

        Groups together data capture and procedures
        Can be reused aacross multiple points within a study timeline via the ScheduledActivityInstance class
        Can be linked to 1 or more procedures, 1 or more biomedical concepts, 1 or more groups of biomedical concepts, and/or 1 or more surrogate biomediocal concepts
        May be conditional

    studyDesignProcedures - mapping activities to CTs for procedures such as SNOMED, Sponsor-Defined (optional); BCs
        Procedures required by the activity to be detailed

    
    studyDesignTiming - timing of encounters (visits) and the activities to be performed within those encounters (optional - although we should define visit windows)
        Allows for multiple planned timings within an encounter as well as for decision points in the study processing
        Scheduled Activity Instances and Scheduled Decision Instances
            Inherit from ScheduledInstance classes

        Timeline - components
            entry point with entry conditions (ScheduleTimeline class)
            sequence of steps (ScheduledActivityInstance class and ScheduledDecisionInstance class)
            timing relating the steps (Timing class)
            1 or more exists (ScheduledTimelineExit)

            ScheduledActivityInstance is the link between high-level study design defined by the StudyArms and StudyEpochs classes, the Encounter classes, and the detailed study design defined by the Activity class

        Timing
            Relative time of before or after, and an anchor time that is Fixed

        Decisions and Branching
            Handled using instances of SchedueledDecisionInstance class within a timeline

        Unscheduled Visists
            Handled by creating separate timelines for each unscheduled "event" that needs to be handled within the study design
            A study would typically have 1 "main" timeline with a condition such as "subject identified"
            Further timelines can be created and linked to the StudyDesign instance with the timeline having an appropriate conidition (e.g. Adverse Event, Lost contact with the subject)

    activityInstanceTimeline - unplanned visits --> When do we create instance classes? 

    Azure OpenAI Key - GPT3.5 or 4o?
                    Token Limit?


TODO (9/12):
    - Update eCRF sample forms to include scenario-based forms (local collection, central collection, etc.)
        - Requires additional CDISC Library API calls and data wrangling to finalize the JSON / CSV structure that is fed in
    
    - Build initial prompts for SOA Visit --> USDM Encounters sheet / structure drafting

    - Build initial prompts for final 'Main Timeline' creation
        Decision to exclude specific timelines for unplanned visits and acitivities that consist of a series of procedures

    - Test the Azure OpenAI Key - Requires the 'endpoint' be defined to establish the connection
    - Finalize follow-along Jupyter notebooks for automation of edc build;
