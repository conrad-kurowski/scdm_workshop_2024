The CDASH Model, the CDASH Implementation Guide (CDASHIG), and the CDASHIG metadata tables define basic standards for the collection of clinical trial data and how to implement the standard for specific case report forms (CRFs). Although the CDASH standard was originally developed for use in regulatory submissions, it can be used by any organization or individual involved in the collection, preparation, and analysis of clinical research data that may also be used for other purposes, including publication, warehousing, and meta-analyses. Data collection formats and structures provide clear traceability of submission data into the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM), delivering more transparency to regulators and others who conduct data review.\",\n",

The CDASH Model, the CDASH Implementation Guide (CDASHIG), and the CDASHIG metadata tables define basic standards for the collection of clinical trial data and how to implement the standard for specific case report forms (CRFs). Although the CDASH standard was originally developed for use in regulatory submissions, it can be used by any organization or individual involved in the collection, preparation, and analysis of clinical research data that may also be used for other purposes, including publication, warehousing, and meta-analyses. Data collection formats and structures provide clear traceability of submission data into the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM), delivering more transparency to regulators and others who conduct data review.\",\n",
