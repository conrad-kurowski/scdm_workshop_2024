To generate the final output specification for the electronic data capture (EDC) system, we need to organize the activities and their respective visits based on the provided data.

From the Schedule of Activities (SOA) file【5†source】, we have the following visit schedule:

- Screening (SCR) occurs between days -28 and -1.
- Treatment visits are structured around cycles (Cycle 1, Day 1, Cycle 2, Day 15, etc.).
- Follow-up visits (e.g., Follow-Up 1, Follow-Up 2) occur post-treatment with specific windows.

Using the inputs from the extracted visits and the mapping between activities and eCRF forms, we can map out the activities and which visit they belong to. The output specification will follow the template provided, which includes various columns representing visits like Screening, Dose, Week 2, Week 4, etc.

This table shows the activities mapped to their corresponding visits based on the data extracted from the SOA document and aligned with the provided inputs for visits and activities. Each activity is associated with its relevant eCRF form reference, and the visits are adjusted to match the extracted SOA visit schedule.
