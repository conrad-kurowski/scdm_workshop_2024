CM,A unique identifier for a study.,"Although this field is not typically captured on a CRF, it should be displayed clearly on the CRF and/or the EDC system. This field can be included into the database or populated during SDTM-based dataset creation before submission.",Study Identifier,Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,STUDYID,1,[Protocol/Study],What is the study identifier?,Char,,
CM,A unique identifier for a site within a study.,"Paper: For single-site studies, this is typically preprinted in the header of each CRF page. For studies with multiple sites, this field may be left blank so that the number can be recorded by the site, or it may be preprinted on CRFs that are shipped to each site. \n EDC: This should be prepopulated.",Study Site Identifier,Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,SITEID,2,Site (Identifier),What is the site identifier?,Char,,
CM,A unique subject identifier within a site and a study.,"Paper: This is typically recorded in the header of each CRF page. \n EDC: The subject identifiers may be system-generated. \n This CDASH variable is typically collected in all CDASH domains. However, this CDASH variable is populated only in the SDTMIG DM domain. For more information, refer to the SDTMIG.",Subject Identifier for the Study,Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,SUBJID,3,[Subject/Participant] (Identifier),What [is/was] the (study) [subject/participant] identifier?,Char,,
CM,Verbatim medication name or treatments (include only treatments with data collection characteristics similar to medications).,"In most cases, the verbatim drug names or treatment will be coded to a standard dictionary (e.g., WHODrug) after data have been collected on the CRF. For the collection of verbatim drug name or treatments, the recommendation is for sites to provide the full trade or proprietary name, which is more exact than the generic. The full trade name provides the base generic and the appropriate salt for that particular drug. In addition, for coding purposes, it helps with ATC selection (e.g., Tylenol with codeine #1 has a different ATC code than Tylenol with codeine #3). This field can be used for either prior or concomitant medication/treatments.","Reported Name of Drug, Med, or Therapy",Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,CMTRT,8,(Concomitant) [Medication/Treatment/Therapy],What was the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy] (name/term)?,Char,,
CM,"The condition, disease, symptom, or disorder that the concomitant (non-study) medication/treatment/therapy was used to address or investigate (e.g., why the medication/treatment/therapy was taken or administered).","This is not the pharmacological/therapeutic classification of an agent (e.g., antibiotic, analgesic), but rather the reason for its administration to the subject. This additional information is collected on the CRF when sponsors want to capture the reason(s) a subject took a medication/treatment. This information could be used as deemed appropriate for coding; analysis (e.g., in the classification of medications); reconciling medications/treatments taken by a subject with provided medical history; and/or AEs/SAEs, as part of the data clean-up and monitoring process.",CM Indication,Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,CMINDC,12,Indication,For what indication was the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy] taken?,Char,,
CM,"The unit associated with the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy taken (e.g., mg in ""2 mg 3 times per day"").","When sponsors collect data for amount of dose taken (i.e., Dose, Total Daily Dose), Unit must be collected as well (if applicable).",CM Dose Units,Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,CMDOSU,18,(Dose) Unit,What is the unit (for the dose of concomitant [medication/treatment/therapy])?,Char,"['UNIT', 'CMDOSU']","['mg','mcg','g','mL','TABLET']"
CM,The route of administration of the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy.,"This additional information may be important to collect on the CRF when the sponsor wants to capture a medication's/treatment's route of administration, for purposes such as coding; also, the medication/treatment may have more than 1 route. Some companies may use route in coding medications/treatments, to be able to choose a precise preferred name and ATC code.",CM Route of Administration,Maps directly to the SDTMIG variable listed in the SDTMIG Target column.,CMROUTE,21,Route,What was the route of administration of the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy]?,Char,"['ROUTE', 'CMROUTE']","['ORAL','INTRAVENOUS','INTRAMUSCULAR','TOPICAL','SUBCUTANEOUS']"
CM,"The start date is when the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy was first taken, represented in an unambiguous date format (e.g., DD-MON-YYYY).","The assumption is that sponsors should either have a Start Date or will indicate that the medication or therapy was started before, during, or after the study period. The preferred method is to collect a complete Start Date. Partial dates (e.g., providing year only) for medications/treatment started a considerable amount of time prior to the start of study are acceptable.",Concomitant Meds Start Date,"This does not map directly to an SDTMIG variable. For the SDTM submission dataset, concatenate all collected CDASH START DATE and TIME components and populate the SDTMIG variable CMSTDTC in ISO 8601 format.",CMSTDAT,22,Start Date,What was the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy/dose] start date?,Char,,
CM,"The time the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy was started, represented in an unambiguous time format (e.g., hh:mm:ss).","Recommend collecting the time a concomitant medication/treatment was started only when a protocol or data collection scenarios supports it. Typically, a start time is not collected unless the subject is under the direct care of the site at the time a concomitant medication/treatment administered or the subject records the start time in a diary.",Concomitant Meds Start Time,"This does not map directly to an SDTMIG variable. For the SDTM submission dataset, concatenate all collected CDASH START DATE and TIME components and populate the SDTMIG variable CMSTDTC in ISO 8601 format.",CMSTTIM,23,Start Time,What was the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy/dose] start time?,Char,,
CM,Indication the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy is ongoing when no end date is provided.,"This box should be checked to indicate that the concomitant medication/treatment has not stopped at the time of data collection. It is expected that every recorded medication/treatment should have either an end date or be checked as ongoing, but not both. However, in cases where ongoing concomitant medications/treatments are not permitted, it may not be necessary to include an Ongoing field in the CRF. See Section 3.7, Mapping Relative Times from Collection to Submission, for more information about collecting relative date/time; see the SDTMIG for information about mapping relative times.",Ongoing Concomitant Meds,"This does not map directly to an SDTM variable. May be used to populate a value into an SDTMIG relative timing variable (e.g., CMENRF, CMENRTPT). When populating CMENRF, if the value of CMONGO is ""Y"", the values of ""DURING"", ""AFTER"", or ""DURING/AFTER"" may be used. When populating CMENRTPT, if the value of CMONGO is ""Y"", the value of ""ONGOING"" may be used. When CMONGO refers to the Study Reference Period (defined in DM.RFSTDTC to DM.RFENDTC) the SDTM variable CMENRF should be populated. When CMONGO is used in conjunction with another time point, the SDTM variables CMENRTPT and CMENTPT should be used. Note: CMENRTPT must refer to a time-point anchor described in CMENTPT.",CMONGO,25,Ongoing (as of [the study-specific time point or period]),Was the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy] ongoing (as of [the study-specific time point or period])?,Char,['NY'],"['N','NA','U','Y']"
CM,"The date that the subject ended/stopped taking the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy, represented in an unambiguous date format (e.g., DD-MON-YYYY).","The assumption is that sponsors should either have an End Date or will indicate that the medication or therapy was ongoing at the time of collection or at the end of the study. However, in cases where the end date can be determined from dates collected elsewhere in the CRF it is not necessary to include an End Date field on the CRF. For example, if all concomitant medications/treatments are administered only once during a trial, the end date will be the same as the start date.",Concomitant Meds End Date,"This does not map directly to an SDTMIG variable. For the SDTM submission dataset, concatenate all collected CDASH END DATE and TIME components and populate the SDTMIG variable CMENDTC in ISO 8601 format.",CMENDAT,26,End Date,What was the (concomitant) [medication/treatment/therapy/dose] end date?,Char,,
CM,"The time when the subject ended/stopped taking the concomitant medication/treatment/therapy, represented in an unambiguous time format (e.g., hh:mm:ss).","Recommend collecting the time a concomitant medication or treatment was ended only when a protocol or data collection scenario requires it or the subject records the end time in a diary. Typically, an end time is not collected unless the subject is under the direct care of the site at the time a concomitant medication/treatment is stopped.",Concomitant Meds End Time,"This does not map directly to an SDTMIG variable.
