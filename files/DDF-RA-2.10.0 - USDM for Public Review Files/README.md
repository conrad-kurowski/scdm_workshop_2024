# DDF-RA

This repository should be used for the *cdisc-org/DDF-RA* project to contain code, minutes, notes, outcomes, discussions and more. It is meant to allow anyone working with the results and discussions to allow flexible collaboration and follow up projects.

## Description

The main purpose of *cdisc-org/DDF-RA* is to create the logical model (USDM), API definition, Implementation Guide (IG), and Controlled Terminology (CT) (together known as the "Digital Data Flow Reference Architecture"). This product, in turn, will be used as the basis for another project led by TransCelerate, Digital Data Flow. The reference architecture will provide a standard for anyone who wishes to create conformant standards-based technologies, which produce or consume study definitions.
